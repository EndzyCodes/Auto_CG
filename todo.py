# todo:
#* Make a gui for clan games challenges
# - The gui will have a list of challenges that the bot can adjust in game, for example:
#       - if the challenge is hog glider and it is enabled in the gui, then the bot will first update one of the army camps to have hog gliders
#       - then the bot will attack with hog gliders
#       - if the challenge is completed it will reset the army camp to the previous army composition
